Copy and modify mdb_example.properties.example to mdb_example.properties in the config 
directory for the domain where icat is installed.

Build the system with maven. The command "mvn install" will produce a file:

  target/mdb_example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  
Install it with:

  asadmin deploy --force target/mdb_example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  
where the --force will make it replace an existing jar if necessary.

Your ICAT must be configured to publish notifications. Take a look at the log file 
mdb_example.log in the glassfish logs directory for you chosen domain.

Then adjust the code - which even includes some comments - to do what you want!

The log4j properties in the resources directory will be respected. You may wish to 
change the default logging level from INFO to TRACE to see what is going on.
