# Introduction #

The Core Scientific Metadata model is designed to represent scientific data, especially as derived within facilities.  Thus it is designed to represent data collection activities for analysing sample analysis.

Here we give a specification of the current version of CSMD, v.3.0.

The reference for CSMD 2.0 is available here http://epubs.stfc.ac.uk/bitstream/485/csmdm.version-2.pdf

The data dictionary describing how CMSD is used in ICAT3 is available here https://code.google.com/p/icatproject/source/browse/parked/old-doc/data_dictionary.pdf

We use some components from the [DCMI Singapore Framework](http://dublincore.org/documents/singapore-framework/) to provide some concepts to describe the model at different levels of abstraction.  Although are are **not** in this document providing a Dublin Core profile, these provide a useful breakdown of the stages needed to document the metadata model.
