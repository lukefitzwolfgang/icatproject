the file "script1.sql" is sourced from elsewhere in the source control system.

a copy is needed here to protect testing the install from changes in the schema.

the original file is :
../jdeveloper/schemadiagrams/database/script1.sql

THIS SCRIPTS SHOULD NOT BE EDITED HERE, but copied from their original
locations before an install.

for tagged releases, assume these scripts are up to date.
