Derby Instructions
==================

Before you deploy ICAT make sure you have followed the steps below.

1) The Derby database does not require a JDBC database driver to be added as it
   comes packaged with the default Glassfish installation.

2) This installation requires that the glassfish3 user has the ij command on
   their PATH.

3) ./properties.sh contains various credentials and database settings. You should
   check that the values are correct before running icat_seup.sh.
