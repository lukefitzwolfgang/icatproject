Derby Instructions
==================

1) The Derby database does not require a JDBC database driver to be added as it
   comes packaged with the default Glassfish installation.

2) This installation requires that the glassfish3 user has the ij command on
   their PATH.

3) ./properties.sh contains the usernames and passwords for the Derby database
   and a test ICAT account. If you make any changes please make sure these are
   reflected in both of the glassfish.props files in this directory.
