#summary python-icat - A library for writing ICAT clients in Python

= python-icat =

python-icat is a Python package that provides a collection of modules
for writing programs that access an ICAT service using the SOAP
interface.  It is based on Suds and extends it with ICAT specific
features.

== System Requirements ==

 * Python 2.7.  (Python 2.6 will do for most of python-icat.)
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/suds/ Suds 0.4].
 * [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML PyYAML].  (Only for the examples, not needed for python-icat itself.)

== Download ==

Current Release:

 * [http://icatproject.googlecode.com/svn/contrib/python-icat/python-icat-0.2.0.tar.gz python-icat 0.2.0]

Old versions:

 * [http://icatproject.googlecode.com/svn/contrib/python-icat/python-icat-0.1.0.tar.gz python-icat 0.1.0]

== Installation ==

python-icat follows the standard Python conventions of packaging source distributions.  See the documentation on [http://docs.python.org/2.7/install/ Installing Python Modules] for details or to customize the install process.

 # Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.
 # {{{python setup.py build}}}
 # {{{python setup.py install}}}

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into the site-packages directory of your Python installation.
