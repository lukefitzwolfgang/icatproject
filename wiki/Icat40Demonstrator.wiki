#summary Demonstration ICAT 4.0

= Demonstration ICAT 4.0 =

There is a system on the internet with a deployment of ICAT 4.0: 

 * http://www.icatproject.org

We will install a certificate, so that browser applications can access content without certificate warnings.  At the moment, you will get warnings.

The front page is a media wiki and this will contain materials and links to demonstations of ICAT, Topcat, and any other clients which people may wish to demonstrate.

We will provide a set of end points and invite people to use these end points.  For example:

{{{
icat40/icat40passwd @ http://www.icatproject.org:8080/ICATService/ICAT?wsdl 
icat40/icat40passwd @ http://www.icatproject.org:8080/ICATService/ICAT?wsdl 
}}}

We intend to provide downloads of client software which is configured for this server.  For example, the following example in the icat40 download package works today:
{{{
./test_one.sh Authenticate
}}}

You have to set the following properties in the file examples.properties
{{{
wsdl.location=http://www.icatproject.org:8080/ICATService/ICAT?wsdl
username=icat40
password=icat40passwd
}}}

We have deployed two ICATs, called ICATA and ICATB, and a Topcat which allows you to view their contents:

You can access the Topcat with the following URL:

 * https://www.icatproject.org:8181/TOPCATWeb.jsp 

We will make lots of changes to this, as times goes on.  We invite you to provide ideas and contributions of demonstrations.
