= Structure of ICAT collaboration =

== Introduction ==

The purpose of this note is document the structure for the ICAT collaboration, as discussed at the meetings of the collaboration on 3rd May 2012

The collaboration has been holding regular meetings every two weeks since November 2010. During that time, several common themes have emerged. In addition, we are now finalising the icat-4.1 release. We will review this set of packages from time to time.

== Notable changes from previous version ==

The previous WP2 - database independence is now complete (code-wise) and is a standard testing and integration job, so part of (new) WP4

The previous WP7 (specific facility integration) was not really part of the ICAT collaboration. If anything from it (e.g. reporting) does become so, then it should be a workpackage in it's own right, or possible part of WP2
