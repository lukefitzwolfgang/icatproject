= Structure of ICAT collaboration =

== Introduction ==

The current structure of the work packages does not reflect the reality of how the ICAT codebase is or can be developed.

I propose the following as a more realistic view of how things are and can be broken down.

I have merged the previous WP1 and 4 together - the security work was fundamentally a core code and API change.

WP3 is really about TopCAT - JDK and glassfish are part of WP1

The previous WP7 (specific facility integration) was not really part of the ICAT collaboration. If anything from it (e.g. reporting) does become so, then it should be a workpackage in it's own right
