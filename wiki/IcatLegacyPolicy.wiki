#summary Icat Legacy Policy

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Icat Legacy Policy =
The resources available for the development, deployment and support of ICAT are scarce, and so we have to use the resources carefully. For that reason, we want to have a Legacy Policy which does not commit us to unlimited backward and forward compatibility. The purpose of this document is to clarify the policy. Comments are welcome.

== Lifecycle ==
After minor version releases, previous versions of ICAT will be supported by the ICAT collaboration for 6 months after the release of the next minor version. For example 4.2 will be supported for 6 months following the release of 4.3.

After major version releases previous versions of ICAT will be supported by the ICAT collaboration for 12 months after the release of the next major version. For example 3.3 will be supported for 12 months following the release of 4.0

== Backward compatibility and migration support ==
A supported migration route (e.g. database migration tools) will be provided to upgrade to the subsequent version of ICAT.

Part of the release process for ICAT 4.3 and beyond will be tests for backward compatibility. An application written for ICAT 4.2 should work without a source change in a later ICAT. Depending on the client bindings, it may be necessary to recompile the application.

== TopCAT ==
The latest version of TopCAT will support all currently supported versions of ICAT. i.e. the current release and the previous release in the 6 month overlap support period.
New functionality in TopCAT MAY not be available when connecting to ICATs that are not the current release.

Subsequent releases of TopCAT may drop support for older versions.

== Contrib ==
It is the responsibility of users of a contrib to verify the compatibility of the contrib with the ICAT in use.

== Clients ==
Most users of ICAT have client applications customised to their requirements. It is the responsibility of the owner of the client application to verify that the application is functioning correctly with the version of ICAT in use.

== ICAT Version History == 
Note that there are example deployments of all ICATs on www.icatproject.org. These demonstrators are available for use by members of the collaboration.
