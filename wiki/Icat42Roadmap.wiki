= Road map for Icat 4.2 =

== Introduction ==
Note that this is a draft proposal and has NOT been agreed with the major facilities using ICAT.

== ICAT-4.1 ==
Note that words like additional, and improved relate to icat 4.1.

== Target date  ==
  * October 2012
    
== Release criteria ==

wiki:Icat42ReleaseCriteria
    
== Documentation ==
    * documentation of the API;
    * installation documentation;
    * release notes;
    * deprecations documentation;
    * build documentation.

== Packaging ==
    * maven scripts.
    
== Changes to the API ==
  * TBD

== Changes to the authorisation mechanism  ==
    * TBD

== Existing operating environments ==
    * Oracle 11g;
    * Java Enterprise Edition 7;
    * Glassfish 3.2.

== Performance ==
    * Performance is similar to that of ICAT 4.1

== Additional operating environments  ==
As part of the long term objective of making ICAT a portable system which is not dependent on specific products, ensure during testing that ICAT4 functions correctly with the following:
    * Java Enterprise Edition 5;
    * Java Enterprise Edition 7;
    * Mysql database, version 5;
    * Glassfish 3, 3.1;
    * TopCat 1;
    * Open-ejb.

== Additional facilities support  ==
The features of ICAT should be compatible with the following facilities which are in use by the community of ICAT users:
    * DOI (STFC/ISIS);
    * BIRT (ILL);
    * ECAT2 (STFC/CLF);
    * CIC (CLF ICAT Chain) (STFC/CLF);
    * IMP (CLF User office) (STFC/CLF-ISIS);
    * Penguin-2 (STFC/CLF);
    * SSO using MyProxy (STFC);
    * xmlingest (STFC);
    * icatuser schema (ANSTO);
    * usage/management reports compatible with reporting tools such as Jasper (STFC/ILL);
    * extended parameter types to match programming language/nexus types (ILL);
    * Mantid (STFC/ISIS, SNS);
    * DUO (STFC/DLS);
    * GDA (Generic Data Aquisition) (STFC/DLS);
    * Additional authorisation plugin for direct LDAP authorisation;
    * REST web service interface (STFC);
    * Sonatype Nexus Maven Repository;
    * Jenkins;
    * Sonar;
    * Techwriter Documentation System;
    * www.icatproject.org;
    * lightweight deployment configuration;
    * Python interface.

== Packaging changes  ==
    * xmlingest becomes an option (plugin).

== Database support  ==
    * Oracle 10g;
    * Oracle 11g;
    * MySQL 5.3.

== Deprecations  ==
    * Documentation on deprecations;

== Removals  ==
    * None

== Related, but separate products  ==
    * TopCat 1.0;
    * Oracle Database 10g, 11g;
    * MySql 5.3;
    * Java Enterprise 5, 6, 7;
    * Glassfish 3;
    * Apache Maven 3;
    
== Wish list  == 

    * improved error handling in XMLingest;
    * return of the study aggregation of investigations;
    * Software / application table links;
    * ability to do some cross ICAT relationships, for example at the level of a study, such so an ISIS investigation can be related to Diamond and ILL investigations which are part of the same research program.
