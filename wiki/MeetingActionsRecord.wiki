=== Notes 52 ===

Steve reported that he had only a small amount of feedback about the content of ICAT 4.3 and so he would post to the mailing list again.

Shelly asked if people with experience of calling the ICAT API in C++ could provide advice on which package to use.  Gsoap is a candidate.

Krister asked that we add a note to the web site about lunch being available before the ICAT meeting in Lund.  He also said that he intends to send out another announcement about the meeting in Lund.  Krister said that a representative of ESS would attend the ICAT workshop in Lund; he said that ESS is a potential big user of ICAT.

Jamie asked that changes be included in ICAT 4.3 to support ILL.  He will send a note to the mailing list about this.

Antony and Frazer lead a discussion of the plans for IDS.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata.  He reported that SV[2] was held on 1st February, but it had not been possible to include meta-data ingestion in the verification.

=== Notes 50 ===

Shelly asked that additional information such as venue, contact names and hotel details be added to the wiki for the conference in Sweden.  See actions 50.01 and 50.02.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata, but requires data from Thorsten in DESY.  Thorsten is still on vacation and so the deliverable will be delayed until the data is available.  He is expecting to use the data for the next service verification on 1 February.  When this has occurred, the deliverable can be completed.

Steve reported  that he was considering including some speculative features in ICAT 4.3.  These speculative features are being introduced to support data mining and they may change or be removed from future ICATs.  There was discussion about how to achieve this.  The meeting did not agree any particular mechanism.  It was proposed that odd numbered minor revisions such as 4.3 may contain such features, but even numbered revisions such as 4.2 and 4.4 do not.  A facility using ICAT would normally go from even to even.  However where a Facility requires a speculative feature, then it may deploy an odd version on the understanding that the interface to the speculative feature may change.  See action 50.03.

The meeting finished at 15:30.
