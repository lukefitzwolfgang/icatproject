We could not contact George for the meeting, but he send this report:

1. The installation and testing will happen the following weeks as some key persons were not available these days.

2. The date for WP4 PaNdata telco will be announced next week.

3. During the WP4 telco we will identify the ICAT responsible for most facilities. (but I expect to be slow procedure as the WP has just started).
