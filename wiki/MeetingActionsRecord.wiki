=== Notes 58 ===

The meeting discussed actions and updated the status of actions.

SMF stated that a 4.2.5 version of ICAT would be released to fix a thread/memory leak related to the initialisation of log4j. He was reminded that there may be a problem with the frequency of access to the sequence table and that this might also go into 4.2.5. 

SMF stated that ICAT 4.3.0 would include the changes required by ISIS for a more powerful query language supporting more complex authz rules.

In AM's absence GK reported on PaNdata SV4 which will start next week and be based on "Big V".

AOB: 

SR reported that she was working with APS on a new pilot project

SMF asked if there was any interest in a "File Authenticator". There wasn't so it will not happen. The question then arose can we find out what authenticators are present and what credentials they require. TopCAT can manage without but at the expense of having to configure a plugin correctly. A new requirement will be added.

AW reported that there was good progress on Noris's admin interface to TopCAT.

It was reported that the Chinese Neutron Source have successfully deployed an ICAT and TopCAT.

Finally GKM reported that "Actors" had been added to DAWN.

== Meeting 57 - 18 April 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meetings 56 (Alistair)
 * Icat Data Server (IDS) development (Antony)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 57 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status of actions.

The meeting discussed the arrival of CCFE as a collaborator.  Alistair agreed to send a note to the collaboration about this.  There is now a note called InductionProcess on the wiki.  The intention is to follow this process and to enhance the note.  The purpose of this is to ensure that new partners get off to a good start.  We look forward to having a representative of CCFE attend one of these meetings.

The meeting discussed the status of the reference implementation of the IDS.  One part of this is called the Download Manager.  This is now in pre-production with both the ISIS and DLS facilities.  It will also be used as part of the service verification which will be conducted by Pandata.  It was agreed to make a distribution of the download manager.  This is a technology preview, and should only be used for testing.

As Steve Fisher is on vacation, the meeting did not discuss the status of ICAT 4.3.

Tom has created a google group called icat-issues@googlegroups.com.  Alistair agreed to add a link to this group on http://www.icatproject.org. 

The meeting concluded after 20 minutes.  A new record for brevity!

 * Discussion of the agenda for the collaboration meetings Spring 2013
 * Update from PaN-data (Milan/George)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 55 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status.

The meeting discussed the conference in Lund.  It was generally agreed that it was successful.  A number of items are worthy of note:
 
 * Sites such as Alba may have to enhance the reference implementation of IDS when it is available, to meet their requirements for data management;
 * There were presentations at the Pandata meeeting (such as Tom's on ICAT and Umbrella integration) which should be made available to the ICAT collaboration;
 * There should be a half day ICAT workshop added to the Pandata meeting in Barcelona in September;
 * There will be a Pandata WP4 telco next week to discuss matters arising from the Pandata meeting in Lund.

The meeting discussed topics to be addressed in the next three months of collaboration meetings - see the list above.

The meeting finished at 15h35.

=== Notes 52 ===

Steve reported that he had only a small amount of feedback about the content of ICAT 4.3 and so he would post to the mailing list again.

Shelly asked if people with experience of calling the ICAT API in C++ could provide advice on which package to use.  Gsoap is a candidate.

Krister asked that we add a note to the web site about lunch being available before the ICAT meeting in Lund.  He also said that he intends to send out another announcement about the meeting in Lund.  Krister said that a representative of ESS would attend the ICAT workshop in Lund; he said that ESS is a potential big user of ICAT.

Jamie asked that changes be included in ICAT 4.3 to support ILL.  He will send a note to the mailing list about this.

Antony and Frazer lead a discussion of the plans for IDS.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata.  He reported that SV[2] was held on 1st February, but it had not been possible to include meta-data ingestion in the verification.
