=== Notes 45 ===

There was was an excellent attendance at the meeting with Juergen, Jamie and Julian attending for the first time.

The CRISP project has written a deliverable comparing meta data catalogs and selected ICAT as the preferred catalog.

Tom was absent, so discussion of icat 4.3 was deferred.

Pandata is planning a series of monthly service verifications, with sv-0 planned for 9 November 2012.

ESRF proposes the following changes for icat 4.3:

 * Add a property to icat.properties to deploy to http rather than http;

 * Add additional properties to auth_ldap.properties to support deployment at ESRF;

 * Change the installation scripts such as create.sh and glassfish.props to enhance support for domains other than domain1;

 * Eliminate the need for the user to supply the authentication mechanism (ie db or ldap).
 
The DLS deployment of 4.2 is making good progress and full deployment is planned for the close-down period in January 2013.

The ISIS deployment of 4.2 is making good progress and full deployment is planned for the close-down period in December 2012.

The CLF deployment of 4.2 is making good progress and full deployment is planned for November 2012.

It was noted that the 1st of November is a public holiday in both France and Italy so attendance will be reduced for the meeting on that day.

=== Notes 44 ===

Kevin reported that the meeting at NOBUGS2012 had gone well and that the materials from the presentations are on the wiki for download.

Steve reported that ICAT 4.2.1 has been available for two weeks, and that it has been installed on pre-production service for CLF at RAL.

As Tom was not present, discussion of ICAT 4.3 is deferred to the next meeting.

Milan reported that the PanData review is in Brussels on 26-27/11.  He would like to report that the Service Verifications have started and that there are six organisations participating.   He also reported that there is a deliverable due in December on the progress of the deployments.  Alistair reported that we would visit ILL/ESRF on 18-19/10 and that the first Service Verification should take place around 3 November 2012.

Ghita reported that there is a meeting scheduled for 11/10/12 about the migration to ICAT 4.3.  There is now a test server in DLS running 4.2, but there is no data available.  DLS is planning to migrate to ICAT 4.3 during the next shutdown period at the beginning of December 2012.

As Tom was not present, there was no discussion about the deployment for ISIS.

Alistair reported that a pre-production server is running ICAT 4.2 for CLF and that migration to ICAT 4.3 will happen in December 2012.

Alistair reported that he had visited the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne.  the data catalog uses Tardis and the development work is done by a group in Monash University.  They are interested in integrating Tardis with Pandata using Topcat.  During 2013, the lead software engineer for this work will visit RAL to work on a prototype implementation.

Nicola reported that work on installing ICAT 4.2.1 was in progress at ILL and ESRF.

Shelly reported that she added the following two modules to the icat project contrib repository: 

1.	icat-rest-ws is a java based restful web service that retrieves certain metadata with open access such as runs proposals for a given instruments, runs for a given proposal, and file locations of a given run etc.. Tom documented a use case note at: http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/wiki/AnonAccessToMetadata

2.	ingestNexus python script would read a Nexus file, parse metadata, create ICAT client objects, and calling ICAT server for cataloging. I plan to add more comments to the readme file of this module to explain what it does and how it works.

=== Notes 40 ===
Steve mentioned the timing issue in 4.1

Tom indicated that ISIS would like XMLIngest back - but they will modify it to use the new API efficiently and attempt to make it generic.

The purpose and format of the ICAT workshop at NOBUGS was discussed. It was thought that a tutorial might be useful. Neither Alistair nor Steve will be present.

Ghita would like some data in an ICAT 4.1 to test her eclipse plugin.
