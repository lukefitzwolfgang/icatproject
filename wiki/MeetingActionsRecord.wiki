=== Notes 40 ===
Steve mentioned the timing issue in 4.1

Tom indicated that ISIS would like XMLIngest back - but they will modify it to use the new API efficiently and attempt to make it generic.

The purpose and format of the ICAT workshop at NOBUGS was discussed. It was thought that a tutorial might be useful.Neither Alistair nor Steve will be present.

Ghita would like some data in an ICAT 4.1 to test her eclipse plugin.
