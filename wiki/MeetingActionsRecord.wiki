=== Notes 59 ===

Steve reported that Antony has now left the collaboration as he has a new job within STFC SCD.  Alistair was asked to make an announcement about the availability of the technology preview of the IDS.  Alistair reported that the IDS preview had performed well during the service verification on 10 May 2013.

Steve reported that the anonymous authenticator is now available.  Alistair reported that he has successfully deployed it for one of the test icats for Pandata.

Kevin reported that he has deployed ICAT 4.2.5 in production for CLF at RAL.  This appears to have cured the problem of memory leak and improved the reliability of ICAT.

Kevin and Tom both reported that adding additional indexes to some of the tables in the database has made a large difference to the time required for queries.  The response time is much lower, and it is much more consistent.

There was discussion of how to implement index generation in ICAT 4.3.  There is not a standard way in SQL to tell a database to create indexes.  Furthermore, the tables which requires the indexes can vary from one installation to another.  There is a way to tell EclipseLink to generate indexes in tables, but this does not work if a different persistence provider is used.  It was agreed to provide documentation on index generation.

Steve reported that adding the extensions to the query language for ICAT to support the changes to the schema to be introduced in icat 4.3 is rather complicated and would delay the availability of ICAT 4.3.  It was agreed that Steve should take the time to get it correct, and if it delays ICAT 4.3 until after the summer recess, this would be satisfactory.  [There is a requirement of Pandata that the changes to the schema of ICAT are required by October 2013 - Ed].

== Meeting 58 - 2 May 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meetings 57 (SMF)
 * Status of ICAT 4.3 (SMF)
 * Status of SV4 of Pandata (AM)
 * Status of CCFE (AM)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 58 ===

The meeting discussed actions and updated the status of actions.

SMF stated that a 4.2.5 version of ICAT would be released to fix a thread/memory leak related to the initialisation of log4j. He was reminded that there may be a problem with the frequency of access to the sequence table and that this might also go into 4.2.5. 

SMF stated that ICAT 4.3.0 would include the changes required by ISIS for a more powerful query language supporting more complex authz rules.

In AM's absence GK reported on PaNdata SV4 which will start next week and be based on "Big V".

AOB: 

SR reported that she was working with APS on a new pilot project

SMF asked if there was any interest in a "File Authenticator". There wasn't so it will not happen. The question then arose can we find out what authenticators are present and what credentials they require. TopCAT can manage without but at the expense of having to configure a plugin correctly. A new requirement will be added.

AW reported that there was good progress on Noris's admin interface to TopCAT.

It was reported that the Chinese Neutron Source have successfully deployed an ICAT and TopCAT.

Finally GKM reported that "Actors" had been added to DAWN.

== Meeting 57 - 18 April 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meetings 56 (Alistair)
 * Icat Data Server (IDS) development (Antony)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 57 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status of actions.

The meeting discussed the arrival of CCFE as a collaborator.  Alistair agreed to send a note to the collaboration about this.  There is now a note called InductionProcess on the wiki.  The intention is to follow this process and to enhance the note.  The purpose of this is to ensure that new partners get off to a good start.  We look forward to having a representative of CCFE attend one of these meetings.

The meeting discussed the status of the reference implementation of the IDS.  One part of this is called the Download Manager.  This is now in pre-production with both the ISIS and DLS facilities.  It will also be used as part of the service verification which will be conducted by Pandata.  It was agreed to make a distribution of the download manager.  This is a technology preview, and should only be used for testing.

As Steve Fisher is on vacation, the meeting did not discuss the status of ICAT 4.3.

Tom has created a google group called icat-issues@googlegroups.com.  Alistair agreed to add a link to this group on http://www.icatproject.org. 

The meeting concluded after 20 minutes.  A new record for brevity!
