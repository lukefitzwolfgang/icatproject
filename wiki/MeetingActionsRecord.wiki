=== Notes 55 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status.

The meeting discussed the conference in Lund.  It was generally agreed that it was successful.  A number of items are worthy of note:
 
 * Sites such as Alba may have to enhance the reference implementation of IDS when it is available, to meet their requirements for data management;
 * There were presentations at the Pandata meeeting (such as Tom's on ICAT and Umbrella integration) which should be made available to the ICAT collaboration;
 * There should be a half day ICAT workshop added to the Pandata meeting in Barcelona in September;
 * There will be a Pandata WP4 telco next week to discuss matters arising from the Pandata meeting in Lund.

The meeting discussed topics to be addressed in the next three months of collaboration meetings - see the list above.

The meeting finished at 15h35.

=== Notes 52 ===

Steve reported that he had only a small amount of feedback about the content of ICAT 4.3 and so he would post to the mailing list again.

Shelly asked if people with experience of calling the ICAT API in C++ could provide advice on which package to use.  Gsoap is a candidate.

Krister asked that we add a note to the web site about lunch being available before the ICAT meeting in Lund.  He also said that he intends to send out another announcement about the meeting in Lund.  Krister said that a representative of ESS would attend the ICAT workshop in Lund; he said that ESS is a potential big user of ICAT.
