=== Notes 71 ===
Present: Rolf, Shelley, Milan, Alistair, Kunal and Steve
Apologies: Tom

Kunal had looked at a number of choices including GoToMeeting and Teamviewer. Evo was also suggested as another possibility. He will try out one or more products with Milan and Shelley and report back.

Alastair explained that the current Dublin meeting agenda was currently a clone of that for the the last meeting. Steve requested that any site reports should highlight any problems.

Steve went through the draft Road Map. A lot of useful ideas were put forward which will be reflected in the map:
  * Documentation improvements are needed for search and authorization (doing it efficiently)
  * Rolf has data export/import for his python code but it is quite slow. He uses yaml syntax with ids replaced by the uniqueness constraint fields which is similar to what Steve had in mind.
  * It was suggested again that it would be good to isolate the federation part of Topcat. This might be a service in its own right.
  * There was a suggestion that ICE should be incorporated into TopCAT.

PaNData service verification will start tomorrow.

Milan had found a problem with TopCAT for which he will submit a bug report

The actions were reviewed and their stati updated/

The face to face meeting for 2014 has been set for 24-25 March.  The venue is the Department of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin.  

There will be releases of ICAT, Topcat, Authn_shib and IDS around the end of 2013, or the beginning of 2014.  

A collection of ICAT parts will be tested as a group and adopted by Pandata as part of the Pandata software stack release in January 2014.

There is a need to investigate the use of ICATs sharing a single lucene index.

There was discussion about the ICAT collaboration meetings.  It was agreed to reduce the frequency of meetings from fortnightly to monthly.  It was agreed to investigate the use of alternative technology for the meetings.  The present arrangements with voice only connections in a telephone conference does not support visual means of communication.

Steve reported that he had talked to Bill and Stefan in ISIS about Umbrella authentication.  He also reported that he had exchanged emails with Bjorn at PSI.

Steve reported that he was now working on IDS, and that he was confident that the IDS release will be ready in November 2013.

Steve reported that Wayne is making good progress with Topcat.  It is expected that Topcat 2.0 will be available in November 2013 and include support for IDS. 

Frazer reported that ISIS now has ICAT 4.3 available with Topcat 1.9.

Steve reported that ISIS now has ICAT 4.3 available with Topcat 1.9.

Milan reported that SV6 is due on 1 November and that the tests are running correctly at Elettra.

Alistair reported that the materials for the training course on in the installation of the Pandata software stack are almost ready and that the course will take place next week. 

Alistair reported that good progress was being made with the ingester for ESRF and that ingestion into the production ICAT at ESRF will start during November.

(Ed's note - Jamie sent a report that ILL has recruited an additional engineer to work on the ILL catalogue.  The engineer will start work in November).
