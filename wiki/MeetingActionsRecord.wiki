=== Notes 62 ===

Present: Daniel Salvat, Pablo Garcia, David Lopez, George Kourousias, Tom Griffin and Steve Fisher (Chair)

SMF: ICAT4.3 now needs two more things: schema changes with associated scripts and enhanced query language. End of August still looks possible. 

Rolf Krahl's simple authenticator has been released and at some point a class he has written to handle hashed passwords will also be used by the db authenticator.

A SNAPSHOT of TopCAT 1.9 has been made available - no feedback has been received so far.

Releases of ice (an ICAT Editor and icat-setup for editing authz related tables) are imminent. Kevin will test them both before release.

TG: ISIS is still using ICAT3.3 and is waiting for ICAT4.3 with the enhanced query language to support more specific rules.

GK: Umbrella will be part of the next PaNData verifications so will probably need an umbrella authenticator.

DS: Reminder about the Barcelona workshop which is expected to have two satellite meetings: one on icat and and one on umbrella.

=== Notes 61 ===

We were pleased to have Milan join us again.  He has been away from work for a month following an operation on his wrist.

Nicola informed us that he is going to leave ESRF in June to work in a commercial organisation in Zurich.  The chairman thanked Nicola for his work with ICAT and wished him well in his new position.

There was discussion about the appropriateness of the release conditions which AM had added to the wiki.  It was agreed that this would be discussed again, for example when ICAT 4.3 is close to release.

SF reported that progress with ICAT 4.3 is good; that free text search is working and is very efficient; that consolidation of code is reducing the volume of code, and making things simpler in the longer term. 

TG reported that he is working on a simple browser for ICAT.  He will put it into contrib when it is ready.

SF reported that he has done some timing tests on the download component of the IDS.  This has led to changes in the implementation which ensures that the cypher in SSL mode is set dynamically and this generally ensure less time for the cypher.

AM reported that GF 4 has been released and that he has deployed ICAT, Authdb and Topcat on a GF 4 and that they appear to work correctly.  There was a problem trying to deploy the download component of IDS; as this is not yet a supported product, this is a matter for development.

AM reported that he had deployed ICAT with GF4 with an Apache front-end.  This work has been done at ESRF and will be used for the ESRF production ICAT.  The GF4 and the Apache communicate with one another using AJP.  There was a bug in GF 3 which meant that this did not work when using https, due to an error in the GF which continued to use http, when it should have used https.  The bug has been fixed in GF 4.  To verify that the bug was due to GF3, having got ICAT to work with GF4, AM then tried changing back to GF3, and the ICAT did not work.
