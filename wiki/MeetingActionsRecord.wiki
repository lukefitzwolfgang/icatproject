 * TopCAT development (Wayne)
 * Alternatives to Glassfish (Any)
 * Issuing DOIs for ICAT (Tom)
 * ICAT roadmap update (Steve)
 * Issues from ICAT production deployments (Any)

=== Notes 73 ===
Present: Steve, Wayne, Kunal, Tom, Shelly

Apologies: Milan, Anton, Rolf

The meeting startup was delayed by about 10 minutes because of mistakes in setting up a laptop at RAL.
                                                                 
Action 72.0 - Circulate likely time-scales for the items on the current road map is no longer relevant as a new roadmap - with dates - will be discussed in this meeting - Closed

Action 72.1 - Kunal had organised a Hangout familiarisation meeting last week - Closed

Action 72.2 - The IDS plugin interface was discussed in Dublin and the views of Christophe accepted - Closed
 
Action 72.3 - Tom explained that Alistair had had some misconfiguration - Closed

Action 72.4 - Fixed in 4.3.3 - Closed

Steve reported on the 4.3.3 SNAPSHOTs of the server and client. Shelly asked about the need to use Glassfish 4. Steve explained that Glassfish 4 was used for testing and that it allowed the deployment order of components to be defined but that version 3 of Glassfish should still work.

Wayne reported that the next TopCAT release was delayed by about a month. Various bug fixes had been made but the upload facility was not yet complete.

Kunal has started looking at !WildFly as an alternative container. He will report next month.

Tom explained his ideas about issuing DOIs for the ICAT software. He will put this into a posting in order to get feedback on the desired granularity - Action

Steve explained the updated roadmap. A couple of small changes were suggested and having reassured Tom that nothing had been removed besides giving consideration to integration of ICE into TopCAT and the construction of a federation service there was agreement that the updated roadmap - with the two extra changes from the meeting should replace the existing roadmap, but that the existing one be preserved on the web site to show progress. Changes to multi-ICAT searching were discussed, including providing mockups of the proposed designs.

Tom reported that Kevin had been updating their ICAT 4.3.2 to use Glassfish 4. He had had some problems with certificates.

Shelly asked about the date of the next meeting. It is normally held on the last Thursday of the month - so in this case the 29th May.

=== Notes 72 ===
Present: Milan, Shelly, Ivan, Alistair, Christophe, Anton, Kunal, Tom, Wayne and Steve

Apologies: Rolf

Action 71.0 - there has not been much progress yet with the preparation of the Dublin meeting besides essentials such as a room to meet in. This will be rectified over the next few weeks. It will not appear on the actions list as there will be no further meeting before Dublin. Tom volunteered Jay to talk about integration of ICAT and Mantid and also to talk about his experience (as someone new to ICAT) with the ICAT API.

Action 71.1 - this has now been completed and the first version finalised. Steve will circulate a note with probable time scales for the items on the road map. The time scales may become part of the map when it is next revised.

Action 71.2 - a request has been sent in to the icat-support list Wayne is in discussion with Milan about it. This will be closed.

Action 70.6 - PanData release 003 has exhibited no problems. This action will be closed.

Action 70.9 - Kunal has been investigation alternative meeting technologies. He has tried a meeting using Google Hangouts with Shelley and Milan and all were favourably impressed. It was noted that it did take a little while to get used to but the functionality was excellent. Kunal will register people as required and will set up a test meeting for anyone who wants to familiarise themselves with the technology so that the next ICAT collaboration meeting progresses smoothly. This will be in a around two weeks time.

Agenda items except where covered by actions: 

Steve reported on ICAT progress and the problems he has been having trying to add a servlet to the icat ear file. He will work around the problem for now with a SOAP interface for the lucene communication.

Wayne reported that he had been discussing the behaviour of TopCAT with Milan. The next release of TopCAT will include data upload.

Christophe explained that the IDS plugin mechanism did not give him the flexibility he needed. He will send a note to Steve explaining what he needs.

The PanData SV has shown up a problem accessing the ISIS ICAT. This may be a firewall problem somewhere as it used to work. Alistair will follow up on any possible firewall issues. In about 3 week's time the SV will concentrate on Umbrella.

Tom asked if anybody had seen any odd behaviour with case sensitivity of searches.

Tom will submit his authz rules to the contrib directory.

Alistair has discovered proxyvole to search for and use existing proxy configurations. This will be used in the next SV.

Christophe asked how to record which instrument a dataset is related to now that we have a many to many relation between investigation and instrument. Besides using a DatasetParameter no other suggestion was offered.
