= Requirements for ICAT =

The purpose of this page is to provide a place where people can write their shopping lists of requirements for ICAT.

This document will change over time, but the SVN associated with the project will maintain its history.

|| Include licence in downloads and maven builds || ? || High || - ||
|| Provide support for data mining || CRISP || ? || - ||
|| Developer documentation - the status of the different branches in the repository, setting up a development environment, etc || PaNdata || ? || - ||
