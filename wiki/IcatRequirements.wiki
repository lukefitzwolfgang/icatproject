= Requirements for ICAT =

Most of the ICAT requirements may be found as "enhancements" in the  [http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/issues/list Issues list]. This describes requirements for the central ICAT component as well as the related tools.

There are however a few general requirements to be generally observed and which can never be said to have been implemented:

 * Fully supported upgrade path from one version of ICAT and related tools to the next

In addition there are a few which require further explanation:

 * Provide a new API method to allow a quick metadata search without a user login such as start time, run title, run notes, total run time, total accelerator current, sample to detector distance, wave length band used for a given run number or a range of run numbers.

There are a number of areas where there are requirements, but the requirements need further definition; these generally concern integration with things outside of ICAT and the initialisation and operation of an ICAT.  The following list of topics is illustrative:

Deployment, Ingestion, Publishing, User Office Integration, Setup, Operations, Common meta data standards.
