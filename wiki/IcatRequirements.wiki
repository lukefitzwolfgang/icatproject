|| Provide a new API method to allow a quick metadata search without a user login || SNS || High || e.g. start time, run title, run notes, total run time, total accelerator current, sample to detector distance, wave length band used for a given run number or a range of run numbers ||
|| Cross referencing runs - linking calibration (transmission, vanadium empty) to sample data to help automate reduction || SNS, ISIS || Desirable || - ||
|| RESTful web service || PaNdata (PSI) || ? || - ||

== TopCAT ==
|| *Requirement* || *Requestor* || *Priority* || *Notes* ||
|| Upload of derived data through TopCAT || ISIS || Essential || AW working on ||
|| Add ability for data owners to grant permission on their datasets to others || ISIS || Essential || May require enhancement to ICAT rules system ||
