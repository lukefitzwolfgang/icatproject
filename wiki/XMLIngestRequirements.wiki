  # Simple Case: DAQ Machine creates XML file with metadata of datafiles and datafile parameters and calls the XMLIngest module. if any error occurs in ingestion, DAQ client sends a email to the administrator. (SN)
  # Two styles of use: 1) Ingesting permissions and metadata before an experiment (from the proposal database) 2) Ingesting data as it is collected into these investigations (TG)
 
= Requirements =
  * Simple XML Schema (SN, TG)
  * Shouldn't exit by rolling back on problem ingesting few of the elements in XML. (SN)
  * Controllable list of calibration runs (inv_numbers) (TG)
