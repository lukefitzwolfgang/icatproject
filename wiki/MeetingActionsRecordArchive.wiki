== Meeting 71 - 31 January 2014 ==

 * Actions from meeting 70 (Steve)
 * Meeting technology (Alistair)
 * Meeting in Dublin in March (Alistair)
 * ICAT roadmap (Steve)
 * Status of recent releases (Steve)
 * Coordination of IDS plugins (Andy/Christophe)
 * Release and SV for Pandata (Alistair)
 * Issues from ICAT production deployments (Any)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 71 ===
Present: Rolf, Shelley, Milan, Alistair, Kunal and Steve

Apologies: Tom

Kunal had looked at a number of choices including GoToMeeting and Teamviewer. Evo was also suggested as another possibility. He will try out one or more products with Milan and Shelley and report back.

Alastair explained that the current Dublin meeting agenda was currently a clone of that for the the last meeting. Steve requested that any site reports should highlight any problems.

Steve went through the draft Road Map. A lot of useful ideas were put forward which will be reflected in the map:
  * Documentation improvements are needed for search and authorization (doing it efficiently)
  * Rolf has data export/import for his python code but it is quite slow. He uses yaml syntax with ids replaced by the uniqueness constraint fields which is similar to what Steve had in mind.
  * It was suggested again that it would be good to isolate the federation part of Topcat. This might be a service in its own right.
  * There was a suggestion that ICE should be incorporated into TopCAT.

PaNData service verification will start tomorrow.

Alistair said that he planned to produce a report on ICAT from PaNData. Steve asked him to make sure that problems were promptly reported in the usual way (the appropriate googlecode issue list) so that any issues could be addressed as soon as possible.

Milan had found a problem with TopCAT for which he will submit a bug report

The actions were reviewed and their stati updated/

The face to face meeting for 2014 has been set for 24-25 March.  The venue is the Department of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin.  

There will be releases of ICAT, Topcat, Authn_shib and IDS around the end of 2013, or the beginning of 2014.  

A collection of ICAT parts will be tested as a group and adopted by Pandata as part of the Pandata software stack release in January 2014.

There is a need to investigate the use of ICATs sharing a single lucene index.

There was discussion about the ICAT collaboration meetings.  It was agreed to reduce the frequency of meetings from fortnightly to monthly.  It was agreed to investigate the use of alternative technology for the meetings.  The present arrangements with voice only connections in a telephone conference does not support visual means of communication.

=== Notes 68 ===

Present: Steve, Tom, Wayne, Frazer, Alistair, Kunal

Tom reported that the date of the Spring meeting was still being discussed. 

As discussed at the previous meeting actions 61.01 and 60.03 have been dropped - they will be done at some stage.

There had been a lot of useful feedback on the ICAT 4.3.0 snapshots resulting in a number of improvements. The only remaining issue was the inability to install it on Glassfish 4.

There has been some progress with the IDS but not much as Steve has been working mostly on ICAT. He plans to make some changes to the API to make it more convenient to use.

Wayne reported that there had been a review of TopCAT issues out of which the items that should be fixed for the next release were identified. He is working on interfacing to ICAT 4.3.0 but does not have one installed. Tom suggested he should use the ISIS one. Tom will also check to see if he has anything else to add to the issue list.

=== Notes 67 ===

Present: Milan, George, Shelly, Steve, Tom, Wayne and Frazer

It was noted that the date of the ICAT meeting in Spring next year is not yet fixed. It should be done soon.

It was suggested that actions 61.01 and 60.03 should be removed as they will be done when they are ready and are not urgent.

Tom reported on his work testing the ICAT4.3.0-SNAPSHOTs. There were still some problems to be addressed with multiple rules. He suggested 
that the installation script might check for the EJBTimer. This is present when Glassfish is installed but might have been deleted. He had been unable to use the installation scripts on Windows.

Apologies: Jamie (ILL)

The date of the ICAT face to face meeting in 2014 was discussed.  The final Pandata meeting is scheduled for 29 March 2014 in Dublin to meet in the same week as the RDA meeting in Dublin.  The last three face to face meetings in 2011 (Paris), 2012 (Grenoble) and 2013 (Lund) were schedule to meet in the same week as a Pandata meeting.  It was agreed that we would defer a decision on the date until more information is available about a successor project to Pandata.  It is likely that ICAT-2014 will be in May 2014.  We will try to settle the data by December 2013. 

Tom reported that a bug in NxIngest had been detected and corrected.  

Steve reported that the snapshots for ICAT 4.3 and related components are available and he would like more feedback.

Steve reported that progress on IDS 1.0 was good, and that it should be available in October/November.

Tom reported that Mantid now supports ICAT 4.2.

Shelly reported that SNS is now investigating the use of ICAT with autoreduction.   

Alistair reported that he is arranging a two day training course for technical people in Pandata.  The training will include the installation, deployment and operations of the latest ICAT materials including their integration with Apache.  The training will also cover Topcat, IDS, Umbrella.

The meeting concluded at 15h30.

=== Notes 65 ===

Present: Alistair (STFC/chair), Kevin (STFC), Tom (ISIS), Idrissou (Soleil) and Steve (STFC)

There has been an offer from ISIS to host the face to face meeting in March 2014.  It was agreed to accept this offer and the chairman thanked Tom for the offer.  The meeting is likely to be held in collaboration with the final meeting of Pandata.

Steve reported that progress on the collection of parts associated with release of ICAT 4.3 was going well.  There are a small number of interdependencies.  For example ICAT 4.3 requires a new version of Icat-setup.  The authn_db has also changed.  There was a discussion of detection of compatibilities.  It was agreed to review these, following experience of using the new versions of the parts.

There were no issues with any production deployment.  However Tom reported that he was very keen to move to ICAT 4.3 as it solves some of his difficulties.

There was a question about the status of IDS.  Steve reported the technical work was going well, and that a version for comment would be available in October.  Tom asked that this version be available soon, even if some advanced features for remote file systems are not supported. 

The meeting concluded at 15h30.

=== Notes 64 ===

Present: Alistair (STFC/chair), Kevin (STFC), Tom (ISIS), Ivan (CCFE) and Steve (STFC)

As it is August, the meeting was quiet.

Ivan from CCFE joined the conference for the first time.  CCFE is the Centre for Fusion Energy.  We welcome CCFE to the collaboration.

The Pandata meeting in Barcelona in September was discussed.  It was noted that there would NOT be a meeting about ICAT.  However Steve offered to host a web cast session in September where he would discuss the contents of ICAT 4.3.

It was agreed to invite members of the collaboration to offer to host a face to face meeting of ICAT in March 2014.  

Steve discussed the status of ICAT 4.3 and reported that progress was good.  He will make a snapshot of the software and the documentation available to interested parties later in August.  Following that, he will release ICAT 4.3.  During September, he will host a webcast session to discuss ICAT 4.3.

There are no known problems with the production deployments.

Ivan reported that he was making progress with ICAT.  At the moment he is investigating how to integrate ICAT with other meta data systems at CCFE.

Steve reported that he intends to move www.icatproject.org to a new host during August.  The new host will be located within STFC and have a new IP address.  This change should not affect anyone using the resources such as the maven repository on www.icatproject.org.

The meeting concluded at 15h30.

== Meeting 63 - 25 July 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meeting 62 (Chair)
 * Status of ICAT 4.3 (Steve)
 * Feedback on new components (authn_simple, topcat 1.9, ice and icat-setup (All)
 * Feedback on changes to query language, authz rules etc (All)
 * Feedback on guidelines for developers (All)
 * Issues from ICAT production deployments (All)
 * AOB (All)

=== Notes 63 ===

Present: Juergen, Milan, George, Shelley, Tom, Brian, Kevin and Steve (Chair)

There was no progress on any of the actions.

Steve: ICAT 4.3 is still progressing well. There is a problem in the MySQL migration script. It is hoped that when this is converted to Oracle the error may become apparent. It currently looks like a MySQL bug. Besides this the only work left to do is the new query language and related authz changes. Old style queries are being parsed and converted into the new JPQL style. They will then be subject to the new authorization code. This means that because the authz code is changing the data that comes back from INCLUDE may change in 4.3. Some modifications to authz rules may be needed to restore the old behaviour if so desired.

Tom: A couple of feature requests for TopCAT have been submitted, ice and icat-setup seem to work as advertised.

Steve: Feedback on the query language changes had been received saying that we should keep the old language for an extended period. This is to avoid forcing people to change and because its simplicity is appreciated. There seems to be no problem with this. Following a question from Tom, it was explained that authz rules would be applied to included entities but that a mechanism would be provided to say that it was always allowed to go from one specific entity type to another: for example from Dataset to Datafile.

The developer guidelines were discussed briefly. Antony had requested by e-mail the inclusion of something about logging. Tom questioned the need to provide a python install script for the trivial installations, but agreed that, if it were provided, then it should be in python and follow the guidelines. Tom would also like to see some documentation on what the scripts were doing. He was happy to have a verbose option to provide this.

AOB: Earlier in the meeting Shelley had asked about the IDS - Steve emphasised that though it had been made available to parts of !PanData it was not yet a supported ICAT component. Juergen expressed an interest in using !OpenId with ICAT however he has no spare effort at the moment to do anything about it. Brian asked what was being done about organising the ICAT part of the Barcelona meeting. Steve suggested that it should have two parts: one relating to !PanData and a more general part. An action has been added for Steve and Alistair.

=== Notes 62 ===

Present: Daniel Salvat, Pablo Garcia, David Lopez, George Kourousias, Tom Griffin and Steve Fisher (Chair)

SMF: ICAT4.3 now needs two more things: schema changes with associated scripts and enhanced query language. End of August still looks possible. 

Rolf Krahl's simple authenticator has been released and at some point a class he has written to handle hashed passwords will also be used by the db authenticator.

A SNAPSHOT of TopCAT 1.9 has been made available - no feedback has been received so far.

Releases of ice (an ICAT Editor and icat-setup for editing authz related tables) are imminent. Kevin will test them both before release.

TG: ISIS is still using ICAT3.3 and is waiting for ICAT4.3 with the enhanced query language to support more specific rules.

GK: Umbrella will be part of the next PaNData verifications so will probably need an umbrella authenticator.

DS: Reminder about the Barcelona workshop which is expected to have two satellite meetings: one on icat and and one on umbrella.

=== Notes 61 ===

We were pleased to have Milan join us again.  He has been away from work for a month following an operation on his wrist.

Nicola informed us that he is going to leave ESRF in June to work in a commercial organisation in Zurich.  The chairman thanked Nicola for his work with ICAT and wished him well in his new position.

There was discussion about the appropriateness of the release conditions which AM had added to the wiki.  It was agreed that this would be discussed again, for example when ICAT 4.3 is close to release.

SF reported that progress with ICAT 4.3 is good; that free text search is working and is very efficient; that consolidation of code is reducing the volume of code, and making things simpler in the longer term. 

TG reported that he is working on a simple browser for ICAT.  He will put it into contrib when it is ready.

SF reported that he has done some timing tests on the download component of the IDS.  This has led to changes in the implementation which ensures that the cypher in SSL mode is set dynamically and this generally ensure less time for the cypher.

AM reported that GF 4 has been released and that he has deployed ICAT, Authdb and Topcat on a GF 4 and that they appear to work correctly.  There was a problem trying to deploy the download component of IDS; as this is not yet a supported product, this is a matter for development.

AM reported that he had deployed ICAT with GF4 with an Apache front-end.  This work has been done at ESRF and will be used for the ESRF production ICAT.  The GF4 and the Apache communicate with one another using AJP.  There was a bug in GF 3 which meant that this did not work when using https, due to an error in the GF which continued to use http, when it should have used https.  The bug has been fixed in GF 4.  To verify that the bug was due to GF3, having got ICAT to work with GF4, AM then tried changing back to GF3, and the ICAT did not work.

We were pleased to have Milan join us again.  He has been away from work for a month following an operation on his wrist.

Ghita informed us that she is going to leave Diamond in June to take up an academic position teaching Computer Science in a University.  The chairman thanked Ghita for her work with ICAT and wished her well in her new position.

Steve said that work on ICAT 4.3 was progressing well, with the development of Notifications and Logging completed.  He will deal with Free text next.  He said that when he completes the development of a feature, he changes the status of the corresponding ticket to started.  The ticket will be closed when the feature is included in a release.  If further work is required following release, a new ticket will be created.

Alistair reported that he had written notes about the release conditions for ICAT and IDS.  He will send an email to the mailing list inviting comments.

Steve reported that the IJP is now ready for deployment in LSF at STFC.  A paper has been written and will be presented at a conference in Zurich new week.  He agreed to finalise a release of this product and to make an announcement.

Steve reported that as Antony has left the project, we are short of resources for the development and support of Topcat.  We would very much appreciate it, if one of our partners were to volunteer to support or develop Topcat.

Alistair reported that as Frazer has left the project, we have recruited a student who will join for three months from the beginning of September.  His main task will be to prepare the IDS for release.  We are expecting to have Frazer working with the project team from September again.  This will provide continuity in the work with IDS.

Alistair and Steve reported that STFC is going to recruit at least one contractor for several months to support the ICAT related work until a permanent replacement can be found for Antony.

The meeting finished at 15:25 BST.

=== Notes 59 ===

Steve reported that Antony has now left the collaboration as he has a new job within STFC SCD.  Alistair was asked to make an announcement about the availability of the technology preview of the IDS.  Alistair reported that the downloader part of the IDS had performed well during the service verification on 10 May 2013.

(Steve and Alistair reviewed the status of the materials for the IDS on 22 May 2013 and decided that the IDS is not ready for a technology preview.  There will be a student working on this from July, and we expect to have it ready for preview by September). 

Steve reported that the anonymous authenticator is now available.  Alistair reported that he has successfully deployed it on one of the test icats for Pandata.

Kevin reported that he has deployed ICAT 4.2.5 in production for CLF at RAL.  This appears to have cured the problem of memory leak and improved the reliability of ICAT.

Kevin and Tom both reported that adding additional indexes to some of the tables in the database has made a large difference to the time required for queries.  The response time is much lower, and it is much more consistent.

There was discussion of how to implement index generation in ICAT 4.3.  There is not a standard way in SQL to tell a database to create indexes.  Furthermore, the tables which requires the indexes can vary from one installation to another.  There is a way to tell EclipseLink to generate indexes in tables, but this does not work if a different persistence provider is used.  It was agreed to provide documentation on index generation.

Steve reported that adding the extensions to the query language for ICAT to support the changes to the schema to be introduced in icat 4.3 is rather complicated and would delay the availability of ICAT 4.3.  It was agreed that Steve should take the time to get it correct, and if it delays ICAT 4.3 until after the summer recess, this would be satisfactory.  (There is a requirement of Pandata that the changes to the schema of ICAT are required by October 2013 - Ed).

== Meeting 58 - 2 May 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meetings 57 (SMF)
 * Status of ICAT 4.3 (SMF)
 * Status of SV4 of Pandata (AM)
 * Status of CCFE (AM)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 58 ===

The meeting discussed actions and updated the status of actions.

SMF stated that a 4.2.5 version of ICAT would be released to fix a thread/memory leak related to the initialisation of log4j. He was reminded that there may be a problem with the frequency of access to the sequence table and that this might also go into 4.2.5. 

SMF stated that ICAT 4.3.0 would include the changes required by ISIS for a more powerful query language supporting more complex authz rules.

In AM's absence GK reported on PaNdata SV4 which will start next week and be based on "Big V".

AOB: 

SR reported that she was working with APS on a new pilot project

SMF asked if there was any interest in a "File Authenticator". There wasn't so it will not happen. The question then arose can we find out what authenticators are present and what credentials they require. TopCAT can manage without but at the expense of having to configure a plugin correctly. A new requirement will be added.

AW reported that there was good progress on Noris's admin interface to TopCAT.

It was reported that the Chinese Neutron Source have successfully deployed an ICAT and TopCAT.

Finally GKM reported that "Actors" had been added to DAWN.

== Meeting 57 - 18 April 2013 ==

 * Actions from the meetings 56 (Alistair)
 * Icat Data Server (IDS) development (Antony)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 57 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status of actions.

The meeting discussed the arrival of CCFE as a collaborator.  Alistair agreed to send a note to the collaboration about this.  There is now a note called InductionProcess on the wiki.  The intention is to follow this process and to enhance the note.  The purpose of this is to ensure that new partners get off to a good start.  We look forward to having a representative of CCFE attend one of these meetings.

The meeting discussed the status of the reference implementation of the IDS.  One part of this is called the Download Manager.  This is now in pre-production with both the ISIS and DLS facilities.  It will also be used as part of the service verification which will be conducted by Pandata.  It was agreed to make a distribution of the download manager.  This is a technology preview, and should only be used for testing.

As Steve Fisher is on vacation, the meeting did not discuss the status of ICAT 4.3.

Tom has created a google group called icat-issues@googlegroups.com.  Alistair agreed to add a link to this group on http://www.icatproject.org. 

The meeting concluded after 20 minutes.  A new record for brevity!

 * Discussion of the agenda for the collaboration meetings Spring 2013
 * Update from PaN-data (Milan/George)
 * AOB (Any)

=== Notes 55 ===

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the status.

The meeting discussed the conference in Lund.  It was generally agreed that it was successful.  A number of items are worthy of note:
 
 * Sites such as Alba may have to enhance the reference implementation of IDS when it is available, to meet their requirements for data management;
 * There were presentations at the Pandata meeeting (such as Tom's on ICAT and Umbrella integration) which should be made available to the ICAT collaboration;
 * There should be a half day ICAT workshop added to the Pandata meeting in Barcelona in September;
 * There will be a Pandata WP4 telco next week to discuss matters arising from the Pandata meeting in Lund.

The meeting discussed topics to be addressed in the next three months of collaboration meetings - see the list above.

The meeting finished at 15h35.

=== Notes 52 ===

Steve reported that he had only a small amount of feedback about the content of ICAT 4.3 and so he would post to the mailing list again.

Shelly asked if people with experience of calling the ICAT API in C++ could provide advice on which package to use.  Gsoap is a candidate.

Krister asked that we add a note to the web site about lunch being available before the ICAT meeting in Lund.  He also said that he intends to send out another announcement about the meeting in Lund.  Krister said that a representative of ESS would attend the ICAT workshop in Lund; he said that ESS is a potential big user of ICAT.

Jamie asked that changes be included in ICAT 4.3 to support ILL.  He will send a note to the mailing list about this.

Antony and Frazer lead a discussion of the plans for IDS.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata.  He reported that SV[2] was held on 1st February, but it had not been possible to include meta-data ingestion in the verification.

=== Notes 50 ===

Shelly asked that additional information such as venue, contact names and hotel details be added to the wiki for the conference in Sweden.  See actions 50.01 and 50.02.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata, but requires data from Thorsten in DESY.  Thorsten is still on vacation and so the deliverable will be delayed until the data is available.  He is expecting to use the data for the next service verification on 1 February.  When this has occurred, the deliverable can be completed.

Steve reported  that he was considering including some speculative features in ICAT 4.3.  These speculative features are being introduced to support data mining and they may change or be removed from future ICATs.  There was discussion about how to achieve this.  The meeting did not agree any particular mechanism.  It was proposed that odd numbered minor revisions such as 4.3 may contain such features, but even numbered revisions such as 4.2 and 4.4 do not.  A facility using ICAT would normally go from even to even.  However where a Facility requires a speculative feature, then it may deploy an odd version on the understanding that the interface to the speculative feature may change.  See action 50.03.

The meeting finished at 15:30.

=== Notes 45 ===

There was was an excellent attendance at the meeting with Juergen, Jamie and Julian attending for the first time.

The CRISP project has written a deliverable comparing meta data catalogs and selected ICAT as the preferred catalog.

Tom was absent, so discussion of icat 4.3 was deferred.

Pandata is planning a series of monthly service verifications, with sv-0 planned for 9 November 2012.

ESRF proposes the following changes for icat 4.3:

 * Add a property to icat.properties to deploy to http rather than http;

 * Add additional properties to auth_ldap.properties to support deployment at ESRF;

 * Change the installation scripts such as create.sh and glassfish.props to enhance support for domains other than domain1;

 * Eliminate the need for the user to supply the authentication mechanism (ie db or ldap).
 
The DLS deployment of 4.2 is making good progress and full deployment is planned for the close-down period in January 2013.

The ISIS deployment of 4.2 is making good progress and full deployment is planned for the close-down period in December 2012.

=== Notes 44 ===

Kevin reported that the meeting at NOBUGS2012 had gone well and that the materials from the presentations are on the wiki for download.

Steve reported that ICAT 4.2.1 has been available for two weeks, and that it has been installed on pre-production service for CLF at RAL.

As Tom was not present, discussion of ICAT 4.3 is deferred to the next meeting.

Milan reported that the PanData review is in Brussels on 26-27/11.  He would like to report that the Service Verifications have started and that there are six organisations participating.   He also reported that there is a deliverable due in December on the progress of the deployments.  Alistair reported that we would visit ILL/ESRF on 18-19/10 and that the first Service Verification should take place around 3 November 2012.

Ghita reported that there is a meeting scheduled for 11/10/12 about the migration to ICAT 4.3.  There is now a test server in DLS running 4.2, but there is no data available.  DLS is planning to migrate to ICAT 4.3 during the next shutdown period at the beginning of December 2012.

As Tom was not present, there was no discussion about the deployment for ISIS.

Alistair reported that a pre-production server is running ICAT 4.2 for CLF and that migration to ICAT 4.3 will happen in December 2012.

Alistair reported that he had visited the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne.  the data catalog uses Tardis and the development work is done by a group in Monash University.  They are interested in integrating Tardis with Pandata using Topcat.  During 2013, the lead software engineer for this work will visit RAL to work on a prototype implementation.

Nicola reported that work on installing ICAT 4.2.1 was in progress at ILL and ESRF.

Shelly reported that she added the following two modules to the icat project contrib repository: 

1.	icat-rest-ws is a java based restful web service that retrieves certain metadata with open access such as runs proposals for a given instruments, runs for a given proposal, and file locations of a given run etc.. Tom documented a use case note at: http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/wiki/AnonAccessToMetadata

2.	ingestNexus python script would read a Nexus file, parse metadata, create ICAT client objects, and calling ICAT server for cataloging. I plan to add more comments to the readme file of this module to explain what it does and how it works.

=== Notes 40 ===
Steve mentioned the timing issue in 4.1

Tom indicated that ISIS would like XMLIngest back - but they will modify it to use the new API efficiently and attempt to make it generic.

The purpose and format of the ICAT workshop at NOBUGS was discussed. It was thought that a tutorial might be useful. Neither Alistair nor Steve will be present.

Ghita would like some data in an ICAT 4.1 to test her eclipse plugin.

We could not contact George for the meeting, but he send this report:

1. The installation and testing will happen the following weeks as some key persons were not available these days.

2. The date for WP4 PaNdata telco will be announced next week.

3. During the WP4 telco we will identify the ICAT responsible for most facilities. (but I expect to be slow procedure as the WP has just started).
