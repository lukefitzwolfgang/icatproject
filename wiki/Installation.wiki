#summary Installation of an ICAT component.

= Introduction =

The mechanism for installation of an ICAT project component has been standardised so that all installations follow the same approach.

Each component is distributed in a single zip file (with the name ending in "-distro.zip")

The zip file should be unpacked and will contain a README.txt file which will reference both these instructions and instructions specific to the component. Both sets of instructions should be read before continuing. 

The component specific instructions will list a set of prerequisites. Ensure that these are satisfied before continuing further.

The installation command is setup. Some linux distributions have a setup command so either place the current directory at the start of your PATH or invoke the command as ./setup. The setup command will only work in the unpacked distribution directory.

Some components make use of a config file which is not itself to be installed. This takes the form xxx-setup.properties. If it is not present in the current directory when you run any setup command it will be copied from a file xxx-setup.properties.example and you will be invited to edit it and the command will terminate.

The setup command 

== Configure ==

Change directory to the unpacked distribution and enter 

{{{
./setup configure
}}}

This will
   * Copy any config files from a previous installation of that component to the current directory unless there is already a file present in the current directory. If they are both present but differ a message will be printed.

   * If a config file is missing from the current directory one is constructed from the file of the same name but with the ".example" suffix.

   * The config file will be checked for any missing properties

   * The config file will be compared with the example config file and any differences reported. Differences are not necessarily a problem but it is convenient to have them drawn to you attention.

   * You will be invited to edit the config file

Once configure has run succesfully then move on to use "./setup install"

It should be safe to run "./setup configure" at any time to check the state of the config files.
