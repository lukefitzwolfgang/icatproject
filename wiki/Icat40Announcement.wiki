== Introduction ==

ICAT 4.0 is the version of ICAT which is in use in the Central Laser Facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  A site which is installing a new ICAT and does not have to migrate from an earlier ICAT should find that it is not difficult to install.  Sites which have a existing ICAT should regard this as a technology preview, as we have not developed tools to help with an upgrade.  ICAT 4.0 has been well tested for the CLF deployment, and many of the new features which have been added to ICAT meet requirements of CLF.  During 2012, there will be further releases of ICAT 4.
