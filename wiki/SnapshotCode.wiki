= Snapshot Code =

These snapshots exists for people to test before the code is released. The snapshot code should not be used in production environments and should be thrown away when the final code is released.

== Components == 

There are interdependencies the new authn_db needs at least icat 4.3 and icat-setup version 1.1.0 is needed to talk to the new snapshot. I am very interested in getting feedback on both installation and the components themselves. You will find that the installation process has changed so PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.

As these are snapshot releases the url pointing to the distro is wrong in each case so I give it below. This is the suggested order of installation:

 # http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/authn_db/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/authn_db.ear/installation.html with distro http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/repo/org/icatproject/authn_db/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/authn_db-1.1.0-20131003.093239-7-distro.zip
 # http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/tools/icat-setup/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/installation.html with distro http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/repo/org/icatproject/icat-setup/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/icat-setup-1.1.0-20130906.160307-1-distro.zip
 # http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/icat/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/icat.ear/installation.html with distro http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/repo/org/icatproject/icat.ear/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/icat.ear-4.3.0-20131008.092729-9-distro.zip

In addition for ICAT please take note of changes in:

 * http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/icat/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/icat.client/manual.html 
 * http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/icat/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/icat.core/schema.html
 * http://www.icatproject.org/mvn/site/icat/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/release-notes.html

== Fixed in source code but not yet released ==

== To fix before release ==

== Still to do (though it may get postponed to 3.4.1) ==

 * Support for glassfish 4

== Problems that will be addressed in 3.4.1 ==
