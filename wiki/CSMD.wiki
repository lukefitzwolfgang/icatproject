#summary The Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD)

= The Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD) =

The Core Scientific Meta-Data Model (CSMD) is a study-data oriented model which has been developed at STFC over the last 8 years. It captures high level information about scientific studies and the data that they produce. The CSMD is being used as the core metadata within data management infrastructure which is being developed for the large scale scientific facilities supported by STFC including the ISIS Neutron Source and the Diamond Light Source. In particular, it is a key aspect of the ICAT, a software suite designed to manage the cataloguing and access to facilities data. 

The CSMD is developed to support data collected within a facility’s scientific workflow. However the model is also designed to be generic across scientific disciplines and has application beyond facilities science, particularly in the “structural sciences” (such as chemistry, material science, earth science, and biochemistry) which are concerned with analysing the structure of substances, and perform systematic experimental analyses on samples of those materials.
