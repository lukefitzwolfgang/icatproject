  * Viewing the status of the ICAT using a Topcat.



## Participation ##

Participants will work in pairs and each pair will have a virtual computer which will be hosted remotely and access to a remote database server running Oracle and remote database server running Mysql.

Each pair of participants will have a laptop with a suitable terminal client such as Putty or MobaXterm for connection to the remote computer.

  * Mysql Server
  * Topcat
  * a service engineer who can change the configuration if necessary
  * a set of database usernames and passwords for each of the virtual servers

## Other details ##

The remote computers will continue to run for three weeks following the course.

A small amount of handout material will be provided.

The training will be led by Alistair Mills, and there will be assistance available from Frazer Barnsley and Noris Nyamekye.

If more time is required to get the ICATs working, there will be time at the end of the second day, or at odd moments during conference breaks.

There is no charge for this course.
