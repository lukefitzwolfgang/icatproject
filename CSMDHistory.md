# CSMD History #



The CSMD was originally developed as part of the CCLRC Data Portal piloted within the e-Science programme at CCLRC (now part of STFC), using sample data from the ISIS and SRS facilities. The CSMD was then used on a variety of UK e-Science projects as the base  metadata model, including the NERC e-Minerals , EPSRC e-Materials , and the EPSRC Integrative Biology projects.

Further, it has been used as a template on a variety of other projects in the e-Science field; for example, the EPSRC MyGrid project adopted version 1 and enhanced the provenance information and the JISC eBank project has developed the format for crystallography data.  The Australian Archer project has also adapted the model for another data management infrastructure for use in crystallography .

The model has proven adaptable to a wide variety of situations, although not all; the NERC Datagrid project initially reviewed the CSMD, but developed its own model MOLES more suited for data collected via environmental monitoring.  The CSMD thus can be seen as more suited for experimental science, typically an analysis of a sample in a laboratory or facility.

Over the last three years, the major current activity has been to develop a production ICAT for use in facilities, especially in ISIS and the Diamond Light Source, and now with ICAT v.3.3 a robust software environment exists.  This project is using a relational schema based on version 2 of the CSMD but with modifications.   Experience has shown that the model should in some respects be simpler than the full model as some metadata is hard to collect and of limited value.

The ICAT infrastructure and its metadata model has attracted interest across the wider photon and neutron source community both in Europe, where it is being evaluated by the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) neutron source, the ESRF synchrotron source, and the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland amongst others, and in the wider world, in particular the Australian National Synchrotron.  A common metadata format for facilities scientific data allows the possibility of providing an integrated access to facilities data for its common international community.
