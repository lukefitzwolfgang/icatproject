# Use of google code and google identifiers #


Go to:

http://www.google.com

Request an identifier, and Google will create an email such as yourname@gmail.com and this is your google identifier.  You are not obliged to use the gmail email account.  However you can also register another email to be used to notify you about things, and you can provide your desy address.  This way, you do not reveal your real email address to others, but you will get notifications about things to do with the project. Google will require you to provide them with a password. One of the project owners will add your identifier to the list of people who are allowed to contribute to:

http://code.google.com/p/icatproject

You can then update the content of the SVN and the wiki and so on.  You will find that all of this works quite well and once you get used to it, you may even get to like it!
