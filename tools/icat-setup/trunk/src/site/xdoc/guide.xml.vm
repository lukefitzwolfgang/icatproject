        <section name="Running it">
            <p>
                The program has the ability to add, list and delete Users, Groupings, Rules and PublicSteps. It will accept commands from a file or from stdin.
                In interactive mode it will report errors and continue. However when reading from a file it will abort at the first error.
                
                Try <tt>icat-setup -h</tt> to get help. Once connected to an icat interactively there is also a help command which may be used.
