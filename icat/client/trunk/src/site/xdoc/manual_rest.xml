        <section name="Introduction">

            <p>The ICAT4 API is a layer on top of a relational DBMS. The database is wrapped as a web service so that the tables are not exposed
                directly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the information about using the RESTful interface may be found in
                <a href="apidocs/org/icatproject/icat/client/package-summary.html">javadoc.</a>
                However to understand it you must first grasp the idea of ICAT by reading about the
                <a href="manual_soap.html">SOAP based interface</a>
                . The RESTful interface is currently experimental especially the create, search and get calls.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is worth emphasing some of the differences. The SOAP interface wraps the IcatException in an IcatException_Exception whereas the
                RESTful interface throws IcatExceptions directly. The RESTful interface provides a Session object which is more convenient than
                passing sessionId to every call.
            </p>

                Installation and accessing from maven is explained in
                <a href="installation.html">Java Client Installation.</a>
