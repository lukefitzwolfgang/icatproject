To deploy an ICAT you need to install:

   a suitable container to support EJBs (e.g. glassfish 3)
	 
       Note that for a secure deployment of glassfish you should
       obtain a trusted certificate rather than using the self-signed
       one in the distribtion
	 
   a database system supported by elipselink (such as MySQL, Oracle or Derby)
       
       If you are using oracle obtain a copy of ojdbc14.jar and copy
       it into the lib directory below the domain where you will
       install icat. We are not allowed to distribute this jar file.
