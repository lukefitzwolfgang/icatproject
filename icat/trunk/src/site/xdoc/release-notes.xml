        <section name="4.3.0">
            <p>This includes schema changes and a number of speculative features.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "ICATCompat" service for backwards compatibility with ICAT 3.x has now been removed.
                </li>
                <li>A method "void refresh(String sid)" has been added to refresh an ICAT session.
                </li>
                <li>The notification mechanism has been completely changed.</li>
                <li>It is not legal in queries with an INCLUDE to use a "1" in conjunction with and entity name. This will now reliably throw an
                    exception.
                </li>
                <li>New calls testCreate, testUpdate and testDelete created. They are exactly equivalent to the corresponding create, update and
                    delete calls but return void and result in no change of state. They will throw the same exceptions as the real call will throw.
                </li>
                <li>Column names in the Database table for UserGroup have been changed as they were inconsistent.</li>
                <li>The Rule entities are now store in a database table called RULE_. for compatibility with Microsoft SQLServer.</li>
                <li>A file indices.sql is being distributed with the .ear file with indices which may improve performance. You should assess whether
                    or not each index will be useful to your installation for while an index can give a huge improvement to a query there is also a
                    cost in maintaining an index.
                </li>
                <li>JPA mappings for floating point numbers now use maximum precision.</li>
                <li>test.py expects hostname:port rather than a pair of parameters</li>
                <li>Call logging has been added either to file or to a log table or both.</li>
                <li>Lucene free text search has been included via the new searchText call.</li>
                <li>
                    Changed uniqueness constraints to:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Datafile</dt>
                        <dd>dataset, name (-location)</dd>
                        <dt>Dataset</dt>
                        <dd>investigation, name (-sample -type)</dd>
                        <dt>Application</dt>
                        <dd>facility, name, version (+facility)</dd>
                        <dt>Sample</dt>
                        <dd>investigation, name (-type)</dd>
                        <dt>Investigation</dt>
                        <dd>facility, name, visitid (-facilityCycle)</dd>
                        <dt>SampleType</dt>
                        <dd>facility, name, molecularFormula (+molecularFormula)</dd>
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Made all constraint fields not nullable. This is checked by ICAT to ensure that future changes do not break this rule.</li>
                <li>Add a string attribute: "arguments" to the job to
                    store the program arguments that were used.
                </li>
                <li>Relationship between
                    FacilityCycle and Investigation removed.
                </li>
                <li>Table between Investigation and
                    Instrument added to represent many-to-many relationships between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added DataCollection and changed Job to make use if it.
                </li>
                <li>Added new alternate query syntax that may be used in queries and authz rules. It is distinguished by starting with the keyword
                    "SELECT".</li>
                <li>It is no longer considered an error to have no authz rules matching a search call - you just get no data back.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="4.2.5">
            <p>
                This is a bug fix release. If you already have 4.2.0, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 or 4.2.4 installed, then simply remove the old ear file and
                deploy the new one. If you have changed log4j.properties from the one supplied then add an entry to your icat.properties:
                <tt>log4j.properties = log4j.properties</tt>
                which tells the ICAT to use the existing log4j.properties file in the config directory rather than the built in one. If you have not
                changed it then it is preferable to delete the log4j.properties from the config directory to avoid any possible confusion. The
                log4j.properties file is no longer reread, if you have configured your own copy and wish to change it then you must at least reload
                ICAT for the properties file to be read again.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A significant leak has been fixed which was causing an unlimited number of threads to be created. This has been addressed by
                    changing the way in which the log4j.properties file is read. Only if you have a line in the icat.properties identifying a specific
                    log4j.properties file will that file be used, otherwise a default file packaged within the .ear file will be used.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section name="4.2.4">
            <p>This is a bug fix release. If you already have 4.2.0, 4.2.1, 4.2.2 or 4.2.3 installed, then simply remove the old ear file and deploy
                the new one.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Version number updated to 4.2.4 and test updated to ensure that the version corresponds to the maven project version.
                </li>
                <li>LICENSE.txt file added to top directory of the source tree.
                </li>
                <li>Creating an Investigation which refers to a new InvestigationUser now works properly.</li>
                <li>Using INCLUDE with User and Group now works properly. Previously it could throw a null pointer exception.</li>
                <li>Database requirements have been made more precise in the deployment instructions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="4.2.3">
            <p>This is a bug fix release. If you already have 4.2.0, 4.2.1 or 4.2.2 installed, then simply remove the old ear file and deploy the new
                one.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two different error conditions were not being handled correctly in calls to createMany when a user attempted to violate a
                    uniqueness constraint. In the case of a conflict with a pre-existing entry in ICAT the offset returned was -1. In the case that
                    there were duplicates in the list passed in the call to createMany - rather than conflicts with existing database entries - an
                    IcatException of type INTERNAL was being thrown, also with an offset of -1. These bugs are now fixed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="4.2.2">
            <p>This is a bug fix release. If you already have 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 installed, then simply remove the old ear file and deploy the new one.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A bug causing read access to be denied in certain circumstances, when it should have been permitted, has been fixed.
                </li>
                <li>When attempting to format an error message about an invalid list of INCLUDES a null pointer exception is no longer thrown.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="4.2.1">
            <p>This is a bug fix release. If you already have 4.2.0 installed, then simply remove the old ear file and deploy the new one.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authorization rules without explicit relationships to groups (of the form "Investigation &lt;-&gt; InvestigationUser &lt;-&gt;
                    User [name =
                    :user]") now work properly.
                </li>
                <li>It is now possible to use boolean values in queries. Attributes can be compared against literal values of TRUE and
                    FALSE (not case
                    sensitive) as in "ParameterType [enforced = TRUE]"
                </li>
                <li>Null pointer exceptions were being throw with some authorization rules when using an Oracle database. This has now been fixed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="4.2.0">
            <p>This introduces a clean mechanism for handling authentication plugins and provides significant speed enhancements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ICAT now contains no authentication plugins but it does provide an Authenticator interface for plugin writers. If you plan to use
                    the new authn_db database authentication plugin you will need to manually move data from the old table to the new passwd table.
                </li>
                <li>The login call now accepts two parameters, the mnemonic for the authentication plugin and a map of credentials. This change
                    necessitated the increase in the version number to 4.2.
                </li>
                <li>There was a serious performance bug in release 4.1 and to a lesser extent in 4.0. In both case this affected read operations -
                    search and get. This bug in the marshalling of the XML has now been addressed.
                </li>
                <li>Previously JMS messages had the property "query" set to the primary key and the actual query value was not available. They are now
                    assigned correctly to the properties "query" and "entityId".
                </li>
                <li>You will need an up-to-date version of JAX-WS such as the one packaged with Glassfish 3.1.2</li>
                <li>The main database schema is almost unchanged. The only difference is that some text fields have been made larger. </li>
                <li>A bug has been fixed in the handling of enum types in expressions.</li>

            </ul>
