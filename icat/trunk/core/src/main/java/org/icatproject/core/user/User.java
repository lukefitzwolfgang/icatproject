 * Created on 20 February 2007, 15:52
 *
 * The icat3 api enables each facility to plug in their own
 * user database to authenticate and provide personal details
 * such as name, title, email address etc. to the api callers
 * as context information e.g. displaying names of investigators
 * for an experiment instead of just their userid/distinguished
 * name as held in the icat3 database.
 *
 * <p>In order to acheive this, the icat2 api provides a contract
 * (java interface) of methods that any user database (to be used
 * by icat3) must implement.  These methods and their signatures
 * are defined below.</p>
