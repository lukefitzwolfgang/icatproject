# Introduction #

ICAT is a database with a well defined API that provides an interface to Large Facility experimental data and will provide a mechanism to link all aspects of the research chain from proposal through to publication. It offers a SOAP web service interface to the underlying database with an easy to use API. Authentication makes use of plugins and authorization is rule based. The icat-setup tool is provided for initial configuration of an ICAT for a facility and a simple editor, ice, is also available. Please make use of the Wiki, Issues and Source tabs above.
