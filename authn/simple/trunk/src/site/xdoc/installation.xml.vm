                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The authn_simple distribution:
                        <a href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/authn_simple/${project.version}/authn_simple-${project.version}-distro.zip">authn_simple-${project.version}-distro.zip</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A suitable deployed container (here assumed to be glassfish) to support a web
                        application.
                        Testing has been carried out with
                        Glassfish 4.0.
                        <a href="http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Glassfish installation instructions</a>
                        are available.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.
                    </li>

            <subsection name="Summary of steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Please follow
                        <a href="http://icatproject.org/installation/component/"> the generic installation instructions</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Update the icat.properties file for icat.server to see the authenticator and restart icat to see the change. The easiest way
                        is to
                        rerun the setup script for the icat.server.
                    </li>

                    <li>Check that it works.</li>

                    <dt>glassfish</dt>
                    <dd>is the top level of the glassfish installation. It must contain "glassfish/domains", and will be referred to here as
                        GLASSFISH_HOME as if an environment variable had been set.

                    <dt>port</dt>

                    <dd>
                        For each user given in user.list, this sets the password this user. This may either be a clear text password or a
                        cryptographic hash of a password.
                        <br />
                        A password hash must start with a &quot;$&quot; character and be in the same form as found in the shadow(5) password file. It
                        may be created using the mkpasswd(1) utility on Debian systems or grub-crypt on Red Hat derived systems or the python crypt
                        module. The supported hash algorithms are MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
                        <br />
                        A clear text password must not start with a &quot;$&quot;
                        character.

                    <dt>ip</dt>
                    <dd>If access to the SIMPLE authentication should only be allowed from certain IP addresses then provide a space separated list of
                        allowed values. These take the form of an IPV4 or IPV6 address followed by the number of bits (starting from the most
                        significant) to consider.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>mechanism</dt>
                    <dd>if specified is a label to appear before the user name as it is made available to ICAT for authorization. For example if this
                        is set to 'simple' then a user with an entry of 'fred' will be provided to ICAT as 'simple/fred', but if no mechanism is
                        specified it will be provided simply as 'fred'.

            <subsection name="Update the icat.properties file for your ICAT">
                <p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator. As any earlier version of this authenticator will have
                    been removed then it
                    is important to perform this next step promptly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you still have the installation directory for icat then edit the icat.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
                    <tt>./setup install</tt>
                    . This is the recommended way to avoid errors.
                    Otherwise edit the icat.properties file in the config directory for your domain and
                    restart the glassfish domain.
                </p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Check that authn_simple works">
                <p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) with one of the entries in the authn_simple.properties file. It should report that it
                    logs in but may or may not have the permission to run the rest of the test. If it does not report that it has logged in then
                    please check the server.log and the authn_simple.log files which can both be found in the logs directory below your domain.
