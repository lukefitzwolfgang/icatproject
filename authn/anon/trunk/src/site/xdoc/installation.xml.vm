                        The authn_anon distribution:
                        <a href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/authn_anon/${project.version}/authn_anon-${project.version}-distro.zip">authn_anon-${project.version}-distro.zip</a>

                        A suitable deployed container (here assumed to be glassfish) to support a web
                        application.
                        Testing has been carried out with
                        Glassfish 4.0.
                        <a href="http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Glassfish installation instructions</a>
                        are available.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.

                    <li>
                        Please follow
                        <a href="http://icatproject.org/installation/component/"> the generic installation instructions</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Update the icat.properties file for icat.server to see the authenticator and restart icat to see the change. The easiest way
                        is to
                        rerun the setup script for the icat.server.

                    <li>Check that it works.</li>

                        GLASSFISH_HOME as if an environment variable had been set.

                        IP addresses then provide a space separated list of
                        allowed values. These
                        take the form of an IPV4 or IPV6 address followed by the number of bits
                        (starting from the most
                        significant) to consider.

                        is set to 'anon' then any user will be provided to ICAT as 'anon/anon', but if no mechanism is specified it will be
                        provided
                        simply as 'anon'.

            <subsection name="Update the icat.properties file for your ICAT">
                <p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator. As any earlier version of this authenticator will have
                    been removed then it
                    is important to perform this next step promptly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you still have the installation directory for icat then edit the icat.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
                    <tt>./setup install</tt>
                    . This is the recommended way to avoid errors.
                    Otherwise edit the icat.properties file in the config directory for your domain and
                    restart the glassfish domain.

            <subsection name="Check that authn_anon works">
                <p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) with one of the entries in the database PASSWD table. It should report that it logs in
                    but may or may not have the permission to run the rest of the test. If it does not report that it has logged in then please check
                    the server.log and the
                    authn_anon.log files which can both be found in the logs directory below your domain.
